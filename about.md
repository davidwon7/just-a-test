Hi there! My name is LEUNG Chun Kit Daniel! I am a Computer Science student!

In fact, I have only been a CS student for a year by the time I created this website, as I was studying Architecture in the first 2 years of my university's study, weird right?

Many people have asked me the reason why I made this decision. The fact is, I have a lot of hobbies, such as drawing, designing, playing music etc. After studying Architecture for a year, I decided to keep it as a hobby and devote myself into the field of Computer Science.

As I am a transferred student, everything is working backwards for me, that is, the foundation courses are scheduled for my final year, and I am now dealing with other difficult courses. As a result, I have to work ahead on my own to be better prepared for different course projects. This site is also my own experiment towards web development. I will upload my other works at here as well.

This site is powered by [Jekyll][jekyll], in case you want to create a blog which you can edit and update easily, together with the hosting service provided by [Github Pages][github], I recommend you to look into its documentation [here][jekyll-docs].
