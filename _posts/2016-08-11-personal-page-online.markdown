Hello World!

![Testing Picture]({{ site.imgurl }}/img/view-2.jpg)

That is a picture I took from mount Tai Shan in China last winter, it was an amazing sun rise!

And...YES! My personal webpage is now online, in which I will post my works, recent ideas, CV and my contact here from now on. Hopefully with regular update. Feel free to check it out from time to time.
